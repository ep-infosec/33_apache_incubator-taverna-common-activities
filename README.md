## Taverna Project Retired

> tl;dr: The Taverna code base is **no longer maintained** 
> and is provided here for archival purposes.

From 2014 till 2020 this code base was maintained by the 
[Apache Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/) project _Apache Taverna (incubating)_
(see [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200312133332/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/)
and [podling status](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/taverna.html)).

In 2020 the Taverna community 
[voted](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r559e0dd047103414fbf48a6ce1bac2e17e67504c546300f2751c067c%40%3Cdev.taverna.apache.org%3E)
to **retire** Taverna as a project and withdraw the code base from the Apache Software Foundation. 

This code base remains available under the Apache License 2.0 
(see _License_ below), but is now simply called 
_Taverna_ rather than ~~Apache Taverna (incubating)~~.

While the code base is no longer actively maintained, 
Pull Requests are welcome to the 
[GitHub organization taverna](http://github.com/taverna/), 
which may infrequently be considered by remaining 
volunteer caretakers.

# Taverna Common Activities

Common Activities to be invoked as part of 
[Taverna](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/) workflows.

Note that this module relies on other
[Taverna modules](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/code) for
the actual workflow execution.

# Contribute

Any contributions received are assumed to be covered by the [Apache License

## Prerequisites

* Java 1.8 or newer (tested with OpenJDK 1.8)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html) 3.2.5 or newer (older
  versions probably also work)

This code relies on other
[Taverna modules](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/code/),
which Maven shuold automatically
download from
[Apache's Maven repository](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/maven/);
however you might want to compile these yourself in the below order:

* [taverna-language](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/language/)
* [taverna-osgi](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/osgi/)
* [taverna-engine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/engine/)

Please see the `<properties>` of this [pom.xml](pom.xml) to find the
correct versions to build.


# Building

To build, use

    mvn clean install

This will build each module and run their tests.


## Building on Windows

If you are building on Windows, ensure you unpack this source code
to a folder with a [short path name](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1880321/why-does-the-260-character-path-length-limit-exist-in-windows) 
lenght, e.g. `C:\src` - as 
Windows has a [limitation on the total path length](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247%28VS.85%29.aspx#maxpath) 
which might otherwise
prevent this code from building successfully.


## Skipping tests

To skip the tests (these can be time-consuming), use:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests


If you are modifying this source code independent of the
Taverna project, you may not want to run the
[Rat Maven plugin](https://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin/)
that enforces Apache headers in every source file - to disable it, try:

    mvn clean install -Drat.skip=true

# Modules

Each module implement a particular type of 
Taverna [Activity](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/workflowmodel/processor/activity/Activity.html).

# Export restrictions

This distribution includes cryptographic software.
The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions
on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country,

The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes
it eligible for export under the License Exception
ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception
(see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13)
for both object code and source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

* [taverna-rest-activity](taverna-rest-activity)
  depends on
  [Apache HttpComponents](https://hc.apache.org/) Client,
  and can be configured to initiate
  `https://` connections.
* [taverna-wsdl-generic](taverna-wsdl-generic)
  and [taverna-wsdl-activity](taverna-wsdl-activity) use
  [Java Secure Socket Extension](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html)
  (JSSE) and depend on
  [Apache WSS4J](https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/),
  [Apache XML Security for Java](https://santuario.apache.org/javaindex.html)
  for accessing secure SOAP Web Services.
* Taverna Common Activities depends on the
  [Taverna Engine](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/engine/)
  Credential Manager API for
  management of username/password and client/server SSL certificates.
* [taverna-interaction-activity](taverna-interaction-activity) depends on
  [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/),
  which includes UnixCrypt.java for one way cryptography, and can be
  configured for SSL encryption using
  [Java Secure Socket Extension](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html).
